# Shupeng CHAI (柴术鹏)

Overview
------
Hi, I'm Shupeng Chai. I am a PhD candidate in geotechnical engineering at [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). I am currently focusing on the **influences of fault roughness on rupture dynamics and stick-slip behavior** through integrated **laboratory experiments** and **numerical simulations** (shown in the figure).

<br/>
My interdisciplinary academic foundation spanning geotechnical engineering, mining engineering, and geophysics, and two years of experience in university-level teaching bring a unique perspective to my research. My research interests include

* Rock mechanics and geophysics
* Geotechnical engineering
* Planetary Geomechanics (e.g., Lunar landslides)
* Interaction between rock and mining backfill
