Abstract
======
The strengthening of recycled aggregates is a critical issue, as the low strength of recycled aggregates is the main reason that limits their widespread use. The slurry coating method can strengthen the recycled aggregates by repairing the aggregate surface, but it is hard to improve the internal strength due to the existence of pores and cracks. In this study, a new methodology considering dry mixing with fines to fill and bond the internal pores and cracks before slurry coating is proposed. Twelve strengthened samples considering different combinations of dry-mixing fines and coating solutions were prepared, and the basic physical and mechanical properties were compared, including the water-absorption rate, crushing value, and apparent density with unstrengthened aggregates. The results indicate that the proposed methodology can change the water-absorption rate significantly and improve the crushing resistance and apparent density of the recycled aggregates. A high correlation between the apparent density and the crushing value was also observed. Furthermore, the strengthening mechanism of dry mixing was also investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The micromorphology of the strengthened aggregates indicates that internal pores and cracks can be filled by dry mixing fines and then bonded together after hydration.
