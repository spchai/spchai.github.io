Abstract
======
Leading national space exploration agencies and private enterprises are actively engaged in lunar exploration initiatives to accomplish manned lunar landings and establish permanent lunar bases in the forthcoming years. With limited access to lunar surface materials on Earth, lunar regolith simulants are crucial for lunar exploration research. The Chang’e-5 (CE-5) samples have been characterized by state-of-the-art laboratory equipment, providing a unique opportunity to develop a high-quality lunar regolith simulant. We have prepared a high-fidelity PolyU-1 simulant by pulverizing, desiccating, sieving, and blending natural mineral materials on Earth based on key physical, mineral, and chemical characteristics of CE-5 samples. The results showed that the simulant has a high degree of consistency with the CE-5 samples in terms of the particle morphology, mineral and chemical composition. Direct shear tests were conducted on the simulant, and the measured internal friction angle and cohesion values can serve as references for determining the mechanical properties of CE-5 lunar regolith. The PolyU-1 simulant can contribute to experimental studies involving lunar regolith, including the assessment of interaction between rovers and lunar regolith, as well as the development of in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) technologies.
