## Abstract
Rock discontinuities (e.g., joints, fractures, faults, and bedding planes) dominate the mechanical and hydraulic behavior of rock masses in a wide range of applications, from natural earthquakes to engineering projects including slopes, underground excavations, hydraulic fracturing, wastewater storage, etc. Numerous laboratory shear tests have been conducted on rock discontinuities using various experimental setups (Fig. 1). These include direct shear (DS) tests, true triaxial direct shear (TTDS) tests, single direct shear (SDS) tests, double direct shear (DDS) tests, triaxial direct shear (TDS) tests, triaxial shear (TS) tests, biaxial shear (BS) tests, axial shear (AS) tests, oblique shear (OS) tests, and rotary shear (RS) tests. Stress heterogeneity on rock discontinuities is critical in shear friction evolution and earthquake nucleation, whereas the local stress distribution has seldom been applied for shear analyses in laboratory shear tests. Instead, the average stress on rock joints was usually taken as an indicator. Thus, in this study, stress conditions on rock discontinuities in various laboratory shear tests are investigated numerically to account for the influence of stress heterogeneity on shear behaviors.
