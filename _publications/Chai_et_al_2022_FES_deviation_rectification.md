Light poles or transmission towers may become tilted over the design life, which needs rectifying considering safety and continued use. 
The jacking pushing method is an efficient way to rectify deviations of these inclined structures supported with rigid piles, 
but there is a lack of relevant engineering standards and research in this aspect. In this study, a numerical method using FLAC3D is 
proposed to estimate the required jacking force at the pile top to plumb inclined piles in cohesive soils.
