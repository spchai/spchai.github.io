title: "Effects of fault roughness on dilatancy behavior"
excerpt: "We perform laboratory shear tests on rough faults with **millimeter-scale asperity heights** and analyze the four types of dilation or compaction behavior observed during stick-slip cycles. In the stick phases, dilatancy behavior inferred from the asperity contacts agrees well with the variation of normal displacement. The locations of **acoustic emission (AE)** events are also consistent with the potential surface damage regions estimated from the **evolution of asperity contacts** at various shearing displacements. Stick-slip events with compaction-dominant interseismic slip usually occur at large shear displacements on interlocking faults when overriding high asperities. In those stick-slip events, the proportion of large-magnitude AEs is lower, resulting in higher Gutenberg–Richter _b_ values. A generalized schematic model is also proposed for the complex dilatancy behavior during stick-slip cycles. <br/><img src='/images/Research/Dilatancy_DS.png' style='width: 95%;' />"
