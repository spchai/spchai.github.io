title: "Stress heterogeneity in ten laboratory shear configurations"
excerpt: "Stress heterogeneity on rock discontinuities is critical in shear friction evolution and earthquake nucleation, whereas the local stress distribution has seldom been applied for shear analyses in laboratory shear tests. Instead, the average stress on rock joints was usually taken as an indicator. Thus, we investigated stress conditions on rock discontinuities in various laboratory shear tests numerically to account for the influence of stress heterogeneity on shear behaviors. <br/>Numerous laboratory shear tests have been conducted on rock discontinuities using various experimental setups. Those include direct shear (DS) tests, true triaxial direct shear (TTDS) tests, single direct shear (SDS) tests, double direct shear (DDS) tests, triaxial direct shear (TDS) tests, triaxial shear (TS) tests, biaxial shear (BS) tests, axial shear (AS) tests, oblique shear (OS) tests, and rotary shear (RS) tests. <br/><img src='/images/Research/Stress heterogeneity in laboratory configurations.png' style="width: 50%;" />
collection: Stress heterogeneity on faults
---

The results indicated that stress heterogeneity generally exists in all laboratory shear tests, and the local stress on the central portion of flat laboratory faults is almost uniform. More pronounced stress heterogeneity occurs in direct shear than in inclined and rotary shear configurations. The estimated average apparent friction coefficient across the shear interface was slightly higher than the dynamic friction coefficient of the material set in the numerical simulations but lower than the static friction coefficient. Calibrations of fault friction obtained from laboratory shear tests were suggested to eliminate the effects of other potential influencing forces such as equipment friction and jacket restraint. Moreover, the local shear stress significantly decreased as the rupture front propagated through, or in the following slip phase, during individual stick-slip cycles, resulting in a more uniform stress distribution in the slip phase than in the stick phase.
