Numerical simulations were conducted to investigated the effect of stress heterogeneity.

We observed staged friction/stress drop during the slip phases of stick-slip cycles on rough laboratory faults. Numerical simulations were conducted to investigated the effect of stress heterogeneity. The following figure shows the variation of local shear slip and shear stress on the fault at some calculation steps, indicating the rupture process.
